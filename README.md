# Generic Data Structures Library (C++)

A reusable, template-based data structure library implemented linear and circular linked lists, stack, and queue in C++ using object-oriented programming principles.

This project provides clean and efficient implementations of commonly used data structures, designed for learning, academic use, and interview preparation.
